This is a free tool, but they will ask you to donate every few saves. However, you can use the program for free as long as you'd like.\n\n#### Chrome\n[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) &mdash; web browser &mdash; you'll use this to view your code assignments. So free it hurts.","idx":3},"guts-of-an-http-request":{"content":"# Guts of an HTTP Request\n---\n\n**QUESTION**: what happens when you type in [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) into your URL bar?\n\n#### As it turns out, a whole lot.\n\n1. Chrome has no idea what [http://www.google.com](http://www.google.com) actually means, so first, it looks up the **IP Address** for Google.\n2. **DNS**, or **Domain Name System**, is a phone book containing IP Addresses for all the websites that exist on the internet.\n3. Chrome then sends an **HTTP Request** to the IP address associated with Google. An HTTP Request is essentially a text message asking Google for data.\n4. Google's **server** will issues a server **Response** back to your browser. This response is parsed by Chrome (ie: should Chrome display this response data? download it? etc)\n5. **???**\n6. Profit.\n\n#### Ok great, why do we care?\n\nThere are a few key insights to take away here.\n\nFirst and foremost, the main communication mechanism for the internet &mdash; you know, that thing that rules our lives &mdash; is **text**. Literally just **letters and words and numbers and characters**.\n\nThe other main point to take away here is this: the text that is transferred is written in a highly specific manner. It follows a very strict set of rules that can be parsed and understood by the server and the browser. In other words, this text follows a **specific set of grammatical rules**.\n\nThis set of grammar is what determines a **language**. In other words, the text being passed back and forth is a specific language (**HTML**, as it turns out). The browser and server understand this language. If **we** were to learn it as well, we would be able to command the browser to do whatever we want (ie: we would be able to create webpage layouts).\n\n\n\n\n","idx":4},"deploying-to-the-internets":{"content":"# Deploying to the internets\n---\n","idx":5},"basic-html-structure":{"content":"# Basic HTML structure\n---\n","idx":6},"class-schedule-and-location":{"content":"# Class Schedule and Location\n---\n\n### General\nOur class will meet on **Mondays** and **Wednesdays** from **6:30PM to 9:30PM** in **Room 3B**.\n\n### Class Duration\n\n**Wednesday** June 29th &mdash; **Monday** September 14th.\n\n### Location\n\n\n<div>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3023.006396119743!2d-73.99227048459424!3d40.7398847793289!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89c259a3c1dc503b%3A0xbbbe1ddd83dd89c!2s10+E+21st+St%2C+New+York%2C+NY+10010!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1466590613612\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>","idx":7},"lecture-notes":{"content":"# Lecture Notes\n---\n\nPlease find a list of our class lecture notes here in reverse chronological order.\n\n1.

Do the homework.\n2. Push to Github (you should always be version controlling your work).\n3. Using [Gitbot](http://gitbot.co), deploy your assignment to the interwebs.\n4.
